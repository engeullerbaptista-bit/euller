The AI engineer successfully built a restricted access application, R:.L:. VASCO DA GAMA Nº12, with user authentication, role-based access control (Aprendiz, Companheiro, Mestre, Admin, Super Admin), and PDF management. The development was iterative, heavily relying on user feedback to evolve features like user folders, file upload/view/download, password recovery, and profile editing. Critical bugs related to PDF viewing authentication, filename encoding, and frontend variable definition were methodically diagnosed and resolved. A new Super Admin role was introduced with extended privileges. The application was made fully responsive. The process involved extensive use of  and  for code modifications, backend                          RUNNING   pid 27, uptime 0:00:05

The user, Euller, a Freemason, required a restricted access website for fellow Masons, named R:.L:. VASCO DA GAMA Nº12 (originally TEMPLO MAÇÔNICO). The core functionality includes:
1.  **User Authentication**: Traditional email/password login.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control**:
    *   Three hierarchical levels: Aprendiz (Apprentice), Companheiro (Companion), and Mestre (Master).
    *   Visibility: Aprendiz sees other Aprendizes' work. Companheiro sees Aprendizes' and Companheiros' work. Mestre sees all work.
3.  **User-Specific Folders**: Each user has a folder containing their work (PDF uploads).
4.  **PDF Management**: Users can upload PDF documents. Previously, viewing and downloading were required. Currently, the user requested to remove the viewing functionality, keeping only the download.
5.  **Admin Capabilities**: Euller (the main admin) needs full access to:
    *   Remove and add work.
    *   Remove and delete users.
    *   Approve new user registrations via an admin panel (initially via email link, later changed to in-app admin panel).
6.  **Password Recovery**: A Forgot password feature.
7.  **Profile Editing**: Users can edit their names and passwords.
8.  **User Level Management**: Super Admin and Mestre users can alter the grade (level) of other users.
9.  **Super Admin Role**: A specialized admin () with comprehensive powers, including viewing all user passwords (hashed), resetting them, and full user/work management.
10. **UI/UX**: Simple, restricted, traditional/formal aesthetic, with a custom Vasco da Gama logo.
11. **Responsiveness**: The site must be accessible and fully functional on mobile devices.
12. **Content Limit**: Display a maximum of 20 works per view, with scrolling for more.

- ****
    - **Summary of why this file is important**: This file contains the entire backend logic, including user authentication, JWT token handling, user management (CRUD, approval, level changes), work management (upload, delete, list), password recovery, and file serving endpoints. It defines the API routes and interacts with MongoDB.
    - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: Initial setup for auth, user/work CRUD. Expanded to include password recovery, profile editing, user level changes, and Super Admin privileges (e.g., viewing password hashes). File serving logic was updated to sanitize filenames to prevent encoding errors. Access control logic was refined to enforce hierarchical visibility for works and user folders.

- ****
    - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the main React component, serving as the application's core UI. It manages global state, routing, renders different sections (login, dashboard, admin tabs), handles user interactions, and orchestrates API calls.
    - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: Initial login/dashboard UI. Integrated password recovery, profile editing, and user management tabs (Admin, Aprovações, Super Admin). Implemented user folder structure with work listings and pagination. Incorporated PDF upload, viewing, and download buttons. Replaced the generic logo with a custom Vasco da Gama logo. Implemented extensive responsive design adjustments for mobile viewports. Defined the  constant to display user levels correctly. The PDF viewing logic was updated to handle authentication securely using Axios and Blob URLs. Currently being modified to remove PDF visualization.

- ****
    - **Summary of why this file is important**: A dedicated React component for the Edit Profile functionality, allowing users to update their name and password.
    - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was newly created to encapsulate the profile editing UI and logic.

- ****
    - **Summary of why this file is important**: The main HTML file for the single-page application, defining basic document structure and meta-information.
    - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: The document title was updated to R:.L:. VASCO DA GAMA Nº12, and meta viewport tags were added/adjusted to ensure proper mobile responsiveness.

- ** and **
    - **Summary of why this file is important**: These CSS files define the application's styling.  for global styles and  for component-specific styles, both leveraging Tailwind CSS utilities.
    - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: Extensive updates were made to implement mobile responsiveness, customize the UI according to design guidelines (colors, gradients, spacing), and correctly integrate the new Vasco da Gama logo styling. Layout adjustments were made for various sections and tabs to ensure a consistent and modern look across devices.

- **Utility Scripts (e.g., , , , )**
    - **Summary of why this file is important**: These are temporary Python scripts used for administrative tasks and testing, such as setting up initial admin users, creating new users/works for testing different scenarios, and cleaning up test data.
    - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: These files were created dynamically to perform specific, one-off tasks during the development and testing phases, then executed and their purpose fulfilled.

<current_work>
The user has requested to **remove the PDF visualization functionality**, ensuring that only the PDF download option remains available. The AI engineer has just started implementing this by stating the intention to update the frontend. This involves locating and modifying the relevant React components (likely in ) to remove buttons or links that open PDFs for viewing, while preserving the buttons and associated logic for downloading the PDF files. The task is currently in its initial phase of frontend code modification.
